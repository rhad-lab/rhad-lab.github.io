Danielle Benesch completed her bachelor's degree in cognitive science at Osnabrück University in 2019. In 2020, she started her research master's at École de technologie supérieure. During her master's, she has been working on the ``Sensitive Ear'' project under the supervision of Prof. Jérémie Voix and Prof. Rachel Bouserhal.
