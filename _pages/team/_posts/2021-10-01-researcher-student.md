Xinyi Zhang is a Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. Rachel Bouserhal and Prof. Ingrid Verduyckt (UdeM). She is passionate about speech and language sciences, statistical analysis, and natural language processing. Her research focuses on exploring the impact of various factors such as noise, ear occlusion, and hearing impairment on speech production and perception. With her findings, she aims to contribute to the development of more robust voice-based technologies and improve the early diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss. Before joining RHAD, she studied Cognitive Science (B. A. Sc.) with a concentration in linguistics and psychology at McGill University.
