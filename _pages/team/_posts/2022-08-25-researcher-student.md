Alexandre Petrosky is a Master student supervised by Prof. Rachel Bouserhal and Prof. Jérémie Voix (ÉTS). He found a passion for microelectronics, signal processing and human biology. His research focuses on the development of a hearable for health monitoring and studying the impact of the sensors on the form factor. He aims to contribute to the development of a medical device capable of improving the detection of early pathologies through signals obtained from the ear. Before joining RHAD, he studied Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Health technologies at the École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS).
