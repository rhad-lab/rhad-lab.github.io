Yassine is a computer science engineer from the National Engineering School of Carthage with a strong passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. He was awarded a 5-year scholarship from the Tunisian government to pursue his graduate studies in Canada and gained valuable experience as a Mitacs Globalink intern at the University of Winnipeg. After successfully completing his master’s degree at the RHAD Lab – École de technologie supérieure, where he focused on the challenging area of source separation of signals captured with an in-ear microphone, he is now continuing his research in the same field as a PhD candidate, further advancing AI-driven signal processing solutions.
