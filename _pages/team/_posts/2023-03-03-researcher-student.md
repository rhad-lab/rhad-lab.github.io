I am Pierre, and I study in an engineering school in Bordeaux. I am specialized in signal and image processing. This internship marks the end of my master's degree and is for me the discovery of a new field : biomedical and research.
I am motivated by the idea of being able to have an impact on global health.  I want to use my engineering skills in a meaningful way. That's why the research topic addressed at Critias motivates me! My work will focus on respiratory cycle detection using sound captured by in-ear microphones.
