Siyana is pursuing her studies in electrical engineering and embarking on her second internship. With an unwavering passion for pushing the boundaries of science and technology, Siyana envisions a world where her contributions can make a difference in the lives of others. At school (ETS), she is an active member of the biomedical club known as SynapsÃ‰TS. There, she hones her leadership and electrical skills through the REACH project, specifically focusing on the biomimetic arm. Throughout this internship, Siyana aims to further develop as a future engineer and deepen her knowledge of the domain she loves. Her primary interests lie in prosthetics, biomechanics, the study of bio-signals, and signal processing.
