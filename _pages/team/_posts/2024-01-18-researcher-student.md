I am a master’s student in health technologies at École de technologie supérieure. I got my bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Université de Moncton in New-Brunswick, where I am from. I worked as an electrical engineer in the automation field before deciding to do a specialization in health technologies. Dr. Rachel Bouserhal is a co-director of my M. Ing. Project which aims to study the electrophysiology of the spinal cord by recording evoked action potentials. My hobbies mostly involve spending time outside including skiing, running, biking, and hiking.
