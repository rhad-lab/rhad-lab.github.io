I am currently studying electrical engineering at Ã‰TS and completing my second internship. For the fall semester of 2024, I'll be working along with Rachel Bouserhal on an embedded system that'll make it possible to go outside for future experimentation. The system will store the data from many sensors providing physiological signals for later analysis. I'm passionate about everything related to embedded systems, programming, and information networking. Outside of school and work, I love learning about the human body and engaging in sports that require technical strength.
